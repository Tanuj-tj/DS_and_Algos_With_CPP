Stack
==== 

* Push O(1)
* Pop O(1)
* Top O(1)

> Eg. Stack of books

* LIFO (Last In First Out)
* Insert and Pop both from Top of stack


Queue
=====

* Push O(1)
* Pop O(1)
* Front O(1)

> Eg. Queue of people inside ATM

* First In First Out
* Insert from Rear
* Pop from Front

Deque 
=====

* Push_back and Pop_back
* Push_Front and Pop_Front
* Front & Back

<strong>Imp Points :</strong>

* Stacks & Queue are used as helpful data structures in many other data structures in many other problems
* Less variety on standalone problems 
* Iterative solutions to recursive problems can be written using stack
* Problems involving trees & graphs make extensive use of queue - especially traversals like BFS/level order .
