## Vectors

* Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size
* Just like arrays,vectors use contigious storage locations for their elements which means that their elements can also be accessed directly in O(1) time.
* But unlike arrays, their size can change dynamically with their storage being handled automatically by contaier .
* Vectors can be used to create dynamic 1D & 2D Arrays .
* We will be using vectors throughout this course in place of a reqular array .
* Unlike arrays, vectors are passed by value to a function, you may can still pass them by reference if need arises .
