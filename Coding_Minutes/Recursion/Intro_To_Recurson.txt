RECURSION 
=========

Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the soluton to a problem)
in terms of (a simpler version of itself)

Example :
we can define the operation "Go to Home" as:

Base Case 
1. if you are at home, stop moving.

Recursive Case 
2. Take one step toward home.
3. "Go To Home".

// Recursive Function
void goHome(x,Home){
    if(x==Home){
        print("Reached Home")
        return;
    }

    x = x + 1;
    goHome(x,Home);
}

// Main Function
int main(){
    int x = 1
    int Home = 10
    goHome(x,Home);
}


Recursion = Principle of Mathemaical Inducion

1. Figure out the Smallest Case
2. Always Assume the Subproblems can be solved
3. Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists
